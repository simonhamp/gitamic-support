# üëã Introduction

Gitamic adds a **simple**, **beautiful** and **intuitive** git UI to your [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) CP so that you can have more control over your commits.

It's great for solo sites where you want more granular control of your git history, but really shines on more complex sites that rely on live-publishing whilst pushing changes from your Statamic CP back to your git repository.

### Features

Gitamic supports many of the features you'd expect from a git GUI:

* View the 'working tree'
* Stage and unstage changes (in bulk)
* Discard unstaged changes
* Commit staged changes
* Push to & pull from the remote branch
* See the commit history
* File diffs

**Gitamic is under active development.** More features are on the way. If you've got any specific requests, please see how to raise [#bugs-features](./#bugs-features "mention")

Please support this project by purchasing a license, as it allows me to continue working on it. üôè
