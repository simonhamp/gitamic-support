# üëã Hi, Gitamic!

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:green;">**GET 30% OFF ALL PLANS DURING BLACK FRIDAY WEEK!**</mark>
{% endhint %}

Gitamic adds a **simple**, **beautiful** and **intuitive** git UI to your [Statamic](https://statamic.com/) CP so that you can have more control over your commits.

It's great for solo sites where you want more granular control of your git history, but really shines on more complex sites that rely on live-publishing whilst pushing changes from your Statamic CP back to your git repository.

### Features

Gitamic supports many of the features you'd expect from a git GUI:

* View the 'working tree'
* Stage and unstage changes (even in bulk)
* Discard unstaged changes
* Commit staged changes
* Push to & pull from the remote branch
* See the commit history
* View diffs

**Gitamic is under active development.** More features are on the way. If you've got any specific requests, please see how to raise [#bugs-features](./#bugs-features "mention")

Please support this project by purchasing a license, as it allows me to continue working on it. üôè

### Requirements

| Gitamic  | v1    | v2    |
| -------- | ----- | ----- |
| PHP      | 7.4+  | 8.1+  |
| Statamic | 3+    | 4+    |
| Git      | 2.30+ | 2.30+ |

#### Statamic Pro

Gitamic does not require Statamic Pro, nor [Statamic's Git Automation](https://statamic.dev/git-integration) to be enabled, in order to work. It can independently work with your repository at no extra expense.

**This means you can even use Gitamic on your Statamic Free sites!**

But you _can_ also use Gitamic with Statamic Pro's Git Automation. See [#3.-optional-play-nicely-with-statamic-pro](getting-started/setup.md#3.-optional-play-nicely-with-statamic-pro "mention") for more details.

### Pricing & Bundles

{% hint style="success" %}
You can pay for Gitamic in **$ USD**, **¬£ GBP** or **‚Ç¨ EUR**
{% endhint %}

Gitamic comes in a few licensing flavours:

#### **üå± Gitamic Pro - Single-site, annual license**

One year of updates and support. Renews annually at a discounted rate.\
\
**Also available in a 5-site bundle ü™¥ Buy four, get one free!**\
\
And don't worry, you don't need to keep paying to keep using... if you choose to stop renewing at any point, you will only miss out on the latest updates and support.

#### **üå≥ Gitamic Lifetime**

A single payment (no renewals), access to every version of Gitamic. Plus direct access to the Gitamic repo, so you'll get to beta test pre-release versions and have a lifetime of _priority_ support.

#### **üå≤ Gitamic Lifetime Unlimited license**

Great if you're planning to build lots of sites with Gitamic or just _really_ want to support its continued development.

As well as being able to use it on as many sites as you want, having lifetime direct access to the repo _and_ priority support, **you'll get a permanent spot in an Acknowledgements file that will be included with every installation**.
