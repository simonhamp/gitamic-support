# ‚è∫ Creating commits

Ok, so you've reviewed the changes and staged the ones you want to make ready. Now it's time to commit.

### How to commit in Gitamic

Once you've got some staged changes, you will see the commit message box.

Any changes listed below the message box will be included in the commit.

Simply write a commit message ([be sure to make it a good one!](writing-commit-messages.md)) and click `Commit` and you're done!
