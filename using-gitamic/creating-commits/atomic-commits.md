# Atomic commits

### What's an atomic commit?

Atomic commits are self-contained and "complete" in the sense that the changes they record work together as a single unit.

If you ever need to reverse (known as a 'revert' in Git lingo) some work, you will find it much easier if all the changes are clumped together in a single revision.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is one of the most important reasons for creating manual commits rather than leaving it to an automated process: **you cannot achieve true atomic commits when many changes are automatically rolled up into commits.**
{% endhint %}

### The case for manual commits - an example

{% hint style="danger" %}
This scenario is based on real events that occurred on a Statamic site I built and managed for 5 years.

The team editing it was small - no more than 5 people - and we used Statamic v2 with the Spock add-on, which was the precursor to Statamic's now built-in Git Automation.

We bumped into these kinds of problems almost every week.
{% endhint %}

You made some edits to the homepage of a client site that you help to manage - these changes need to be live today, but because you've used Statamic it's only going to take you a few minutes.

Meanwhile, your client - let's call them Jen - has made a whole bunch of complex edits on a number of different landing pages, some of which were saved a short time from when you made your changes to the homepage.

For getting the work done, this should all be fine. There's no conflicts as Statamic lets you both work on separate pieces of content at the same time without any trouble.

With auto-commits, neither of you have to think about staging or committing any work - all the work done gets committed and pushed to the repo, job done.

A little while later, Jen calls you. It turns out all of the changes they made weren't meant to go live yet and they need to revert all of that work. They could do it manually, but they know you can do it quicker with your software wizardry ðŸ§™ ðŸª„

You check the commit history to see what the damage is, but sadly it's a bit of a mess.

It looks like your changes have been wrapped up with some of Jen's changes into one commit and then there are a few more commits covering a hopscotch of Jen's changes over the course of an hour or so that they were working on the site.

Oh dear!

What you want here is a **single commit** for each set of changes: one that captures just the changes Jen made and one that captures just your changes. Then you could easily roll back only Jen's changes using Git's revert feature.

(Failing that, even a commit for each individual file that was changed would be ok as you could work them all out and do them all one by one.)

Unfortunately you have neither in this world of automatic commits: your homepage changes will get reverted along with all of Jen's changes, meaning that, no matter which way you cut it, there's going to be more manual work here for you than you'd like.

It might still be less than Jen would have to do and it's not like your work is lost - it is recorded in Git after all - but it's grunt work nonetheless and you've got more interesting work you could be doing.

Your few short content update task has now turned into an urgent but more time-consuming Git management nightmare.

**This is where manual, atomic commits can save you!**

Granted, this might not happen very often and it's a trade-off - some time spent each time you do some work to think carefully about what's been done and how it should be organised in the repo's history versus potentially spending an extra hour here and there cleaning up some messy revert.

But as soon as more people start making edits to this site, these kinds of headaches become far more frequent... and far messier.

Manual commits, however, allow you and Jen to individually decide which parts of the work you've done can safely be grouped together into atomic revisions in the repo's history.

Then, should you ever need to revert a whole chunk of work, it is just a single commit away.
