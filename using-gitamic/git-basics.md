# ℹ Git basics

Git is probably the most popular source code/version control software available on the planet. And for good reason! It's a mature, robust, and reliable way to work collaboratively through a distributed system of maintaining file change history... and so much more.

This allows you to track changes to files over time, seeing how they changed, when they changed, and who made those changes. This makes it especially powerful for auditing and review! If used well, Git can help you:

* Review your own work, or someone else's, before merging it
* Run multiple streams of work concurrently
* Find when a bug was introduced into a codebase
* See who wrote that beautiful paragraph
* Quickly see the changes made between distant versions of multiple files

This is very useful in a number of highly-specific contexts – Git was created to make building Linux more manageable, so it's particularly great if you're building software/writing code – but in general it's great for managing changes to any sort of text file.

This guide assumes you're familiar with Git to some degree and that you've already got Git installed on the relevant systems.

What we're going to cover here are just some of the basic concepts that Gitamic features expose. If you want to go into more detail about Git, check out the [Resources](git-basics.md#resources) section at the bottom of this page.

### Branches

Branches are the most important concept in Git. Branches are offshoots, alternative timelines, of your project. They are lightweight and easy to create and destroy.

Gitamic doesn't currently support creating or managing branches, but this will change in the future.
